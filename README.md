# Weight-Prediction
A simple Linear Regression model to predict weight using height
This project, titled "Simple Linear Regression Model," is a great starting point for anyone new to machine learning. It's a complete, self-contained Python script that demonstrates the fundamental steps of building a predictive model.

What it does: The model predicts a person's weight based on their height using a statistical technique called linear regression.

Key features:

Data creation: It uses a small, sample dataset to train the model, making it easy to understand the input and output.

Model training: It demonstrates how to train a machine learning model using the popular scikit-learn library.

Prediction: It shows how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Visualization: It generates a plot to visually represent the relationship between the data points and the model's "line of best fit."
